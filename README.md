AIS Task Force Website by Julian Boaler

Overview

This website is a mock up of a field biology-based team that monitors invasive species, much like I do in real life. The species listed in the website are real threats tha myself and others monitor on a weekly basis. I wanted to make a website with information available to the public, but also offer up a service to state parks, property managers, dam engineers, and irrigation districts to manage and control nuisance species. The Homepage serves as the landing site with basic information as to who we are, what we do, and some of the organisms we deal with. The Species Profile page provides thorough biological information and impact about these species. The Email page allows anybody to sign up to regular emails from the task force regarding new invasive infestations, job opportunities, and new research. The Gallery page contains yet more images of these species to really verify the scope of impact and visualize some of the biological information in the Species Profile page.


Functionality

The pages are linked via the navigation bar at the top of each page, allowing for easy browsing. The image carousel on the Homepage gives users a quick glimpse into what these invasive species look like. Likewise, the Homepage has repeated the links found in the nav bar towards the bottom of the page for easy access. The Email Signup page opens in a new tab for extra attention and clarity. The Email Signup also has two required fields (first name and email address) and a dropdown menu for gender. After each of the profiles in the Species Profile page, there are links that take you back to the top of each page to save the user from scrolling.


Technologies

Pretty basic HTML and CSS, with functionality for the image carousel and photo grid system in the Gallery page provided by the linked Bootstrap libray


Improvements

One thing I had trouble figuring out was getting my links in my Nav Bar centered instead of being leftbound. I tried object-align, text-align in my CSS along with attempting to make containers and formatting that way but I couldn't figure it out in time.

Another thing I would change would be scaling all the images in the carousel so that they would remain centered and a fixed size and not be so blown-up for some of them.

Lastly, mapping out these invasive species is a big part of the job field, so having one page dedicated to an interactive map where users can see which species are present at certain locations could be invaluable.
