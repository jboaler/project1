        <h2> Zebra Mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>)</h2>

        <p>
            Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are among the most devastating aquatic invasive species to invade North American fresh waters. Native to the Caspian Sea region of Asia, zebra mussels reached the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s in the ballast water of a ship. Since their arrival, zebra mussels have spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes and into several major river systems of the eastern United States, including the Ohio. Illinois, Mississippi, Mohawk, Hudson, Susquehanna, Tennessee and Arkansas rivers. Populations are now known from at least 23 states, primarily within the Great Lakes and Mississippi River watersheds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zebra mussels look like small clams, ranging from 1/8 to 2 inches in length. The shell is “D” shaped and white or cream-colored with jagged brown or black stripes. Zebra mussels may be confused with their invasive cousin, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). The shell of the quagga mussels is rounder and usually light tan to almost white, with black, cream, or white bands. Both species have byssal threads (or ropes) on the hinge edge of their shells that allow them to attach to solid objects. These threads are unique to zebra and quagga mussels and are not found on native mussels.

            Female zebra mussels can produce up to one million eggs per summer.

Fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae called veligers. These veligers are not visible to the naked eye and are about the width of a human hair. Within 2-3 weeks, the veligers begin to ‘settle-out’ in the water under the weight of their forming shells and attach to firm, underwater surfaces. Once attached it takes approximately one year for the mussel to grow one inch and become sexually mature. On average, zebra mussels live 2-5 years.

        <h2>Why are they harmful?</h2>
        <p>
            Zebra mussels have had deleterious effects on waterbodies where they become established. Adult zebra mussels feed by filtering large amounts of plankton and detritus from the water. While some aspects of filtering the water are positive, the words “filter” and “clean” are not synonymous. Zebra mussels eat phytoplankton, small zooplankton, large bacteria, and organic detritus by filtering the water and straining out the edible material. Phytoplankton and zooplankton form the base of the aquatic food web and many animals depend on them for survival. By removing this food from the water column, zebra mussels effectively starve the native populations of infested lakes and rivers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Zebra mussels cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year by clogging water intake pipes and filters, reducing water pumping capabilities for power and water treatment plants. They can also damage boats by encrusting boat hulls; clogging water systems used in boat motors, air conditioners and heads; and causing navigation buoys to sink. Beaches may become unusable as a result of the sharp shells and pungent odor that are characteristic of bivalve invasions.
