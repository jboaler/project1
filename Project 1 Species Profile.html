        <h2> Zebra Mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>)</h2>

        <p>
            Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are among the most devastating aquatic invasive species to invade North American fresh waters. Native to the Caspian Sea region of Asia, zebra mussels reached the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s in the ballast water of a ship. Since their arrival, zebra mussels have spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes and into several major river systems of the eastern United States, including the Ohio. Illinois, Mississippi, Mohawk, Hudson, Susquehanna, Tennessee and Arkansas rivers. Populations are now known from at least 23 states, primarily within the Great Lakes and Mississippi River watersheds.

            Zebra mussels look like small clams, ranging from 1/8 to 2 inches in length. The shell is “D” shaped and white or cream-colored with jagged brown or black stripes. Zebra mussels may be confused with their invasive cousin, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). The shell of the quagga mussels is rounder and usually light tan to almost white, with black, cream, or white bands. Both species have byssal threads (or ropes) on the hinge edge of their shells that allow them to attach to solid objects. These threads are unique to zebra and quagga mussels and are not found on native mussels.
