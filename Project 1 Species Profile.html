        <h2> Zebra Mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>)</h2>
        <img src="images/zebramussel4.jpg" alt="two adult zebra mussels" />
        <p>
            Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are among the most devastating aquatic invasive species to invade North American fresh waters. Native to the Caspian Sea region of Asia, zebra mussels reached the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s in the ballast water of a ship. Since their arrival, zebra mussels have spread rapidly throughout the Great Lakes and into several major river systems of the eastern United States, including the Ohio. Illinois, Mississippi, Mohawk, Hudson, Susquehanna, Tennessee and Arkansas rivers. Populations are now known from at least 23 states, primarily within the Great Lakes and Mississippi River watersheds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Zebra mussels look like small clams, ranging from 1/8 to 2 inches in length. The shell is “D” shaped and white or cream-colored with jagged brown or black stripes. Zebra mussels may be confused with their invasive cousin, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). The shell of the quagga mussels is rounder and usually light tan to almost white, with black, cream, or white bands. Both species have byssal threads (or ropes) on the hinge edge of their shells that allow them to attach to solid objects. These threads are unique to zebra and quagga mussels and are not found on native mussels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Female zebra mussels can produce up to one million eggs per summer.

Fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae called veligers. These veligers are not visible to the naked eye and are about the width of a human hair. Within 2-3 weeks, the veligers begin to ‘settle-out’ in the water under the weight of their forming shells and attach to firm, underwater surfaces. Once attached it takes approximately one year for the mussel to grow one inch and become sexually mature. On average, zebra mussels live 2-5 years.

        <h2>Why are they harmful?</h2>
        <p>
            Zebra mussels have had deleterious effects on waterbodies where they become established. Adult zebra mussels feed by filtering large amounts of plankton and detritus from the water. While some aspects of filtering the water are positive, the words “filter” and “clean” are not synonymous. Zebra mussels eat phytoplankton, small zooplankton, large bacteria, and organic detritus by filtering the water and straining out the edible material. Phytoplankton and zooplankton form the base of the aquatic food web and many animals depend on them for survival. By removing this food from the water column, zebra mussels effectively starve the native populations of infested lakes and rivers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Zebra mussels cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year by clogging water intake pipes and filters, reducing water pumping capabilities for power and water treatment plants. They can also damage boats by encrusting boat hulls; clogging water systems used in boat motors, air conditioners and heads; and causing navigation buoys to sink. Beaches may become unusable as a result of the sharp shells and pungent odor that are characteristic of bivalve invasions.

        <h2>Water Hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>)</h2>

        <p>
            Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a large aquatic plant native to the Amazon basin. Its thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves are 4-8 inches across and branch out from the center of the plant on modified stems that may rise as much as 1 meter above the water surface. The mass of fine roots that hang in the water underneath the plant are dark purple or black with small, white root-hairs. The stems are spongy, bulbous stalks (called petioles) that contain air-filled tissues that keep the plant afloat. When flowering, the stalks support 8 – 15 blue-violet flowers with six petals each, with one petal being deeper violet with a yellow spot.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            One of the fastest growing plants known; water hyacinths can double populations in two weeks. Some populations in Southeast Asia have been documented to grow up to 5 meters per day. The plant is capable of reproduction by two vegetative methods:  seeds and horizontal stems. Flowers open briefly during the summer before beginning to wither. When all the flowers have withered, the stalk gradually bends into the water and seeds are released and sink to the soil where they can remain viable for up to 30 years. Water hyacinth can also produce vegetatively by producing short runner stems (stolons) from the base of the plant to form daughter plants. Fragmentation, or breaking into smaller pieces, may occur by wind or wave action or the propellers of motor boats.  Once broken apart, plant fragments are easily transported to new areas where they can reproduce and cause another infestation.

            Water hyacinth is considered a noxious weed species in more than 50 countries. Water hyacinth was first introduced into the United States during the 1884 Cotton States Exposition in New Orleans. The plants were given as gifts to attendees, who later took them home to add to backyard ponds. By 1900, water hyacinths had escaped cultivation and become a serious pest. Today, water hyacinth occurs throughout the southeastern states, north to Virginia and west to Texas, and in California and Hawaii. Seasonal escapes from cultivation have been reported from New York, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, but populations did not survive through the winter. The plant previously occurred in Arizona, Arkansas, and Washington State but is now considered eradicated in these locations. Water hyacinth is able to grow in a wide variety of water bodies from lakes, streams, ponds, waterways, ditches, and backwater areas, although it prefers, and grows most prolifically, in nutrient-enriched waters.

        <h2>Why is it harmful?</h2>
        <p>
            Water hyacinth is considered invasive throughout the world because it grows rapidly and can form thick layers over the water.  These mats shade out the other aquatic plants. Eventually these shaded plants die and decay. The decaying process depletes the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. As oxygen levels decline, many fish are unable to survive. Often the waters below water hyacinth masses become devoid of life. Dense plant mats also interfere with boat navigation and prevent fishing, swimming, and other recreational activities. Water hyacinth may also clog intake pipes used for drinking water, hydro power, or irrigation. Because the large plants have ample surface area, lake water levels may decrease due to evapo-transpiration, when water evaporates from the lake surface and is lost through plant leaves as vapor. Globally, water hyacinth is considered a serious threat to biodiversity and human health, creating prime habitat for mosquitoes which carry a variety of infectious diseases including Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (“triple E”) and West Nile Virus.
